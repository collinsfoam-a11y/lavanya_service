## 2026-06-20 12:00 — Initial comprehensive documentation system

### What changed
- `AGENTS.md` — rewritten with stricter rules (must-read-all-docs, changelog
  updates, backward-compat checks, test runs)
- `doc/lavanya-changelog.md` — created this file with entry format
- `doc/lavanya-app-reference.md` — created complete auto-generated app reference

### Previous state
Only `AGENTS.md` existed with 5 basic rules. No centralized app reference,
no changelog, no mandatory backward-compatibility checks.

### Current state
Three files form a documentation system:
1. `AGENTS.md` — 7 strict rules for any AI agent
2. `doc/lavanya-changelog.md` — change audit trail
3. `doc/lavanya-app-reference.md` — complete app reference for agents

### Why changed
Multiple agents working on the app need a single source of truth to avoid
duplicate work, broken dependencies, and incompatible changes.

### What was obtained
- Any agent can now understand the full app in one file
- Any change is traceable with before/after/why
- Backward-compatibility checks are mandatory
- Tests must be run after every change

### Compatibility notes
- All existing docs remain untouched
- No code was modified
- No migration needed
